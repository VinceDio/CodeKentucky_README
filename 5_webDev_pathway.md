# Web Development Project

## Overview

This is my capstone project for CODE:You. The project utilizes a third-party api to retrieve information, that is then presented to the user with a helpful interface. 
The user is able to interact with the information provided by searching for available options. 
The goal of the project is to demonstrate a general knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Resources

The resources I used for this project are as follows:
- [Third-Party API](https://www.weatherapi.com)
    - This provides the weather information seen on the weather forecast page.
- [Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/)
    - The fonts of the headers across the web application are provided by fonts.google.com
- [Icons](https://fonts.google.com/icons)
    - The icons in the navigation menu were selected from this resource.


### Project Overview
---

The project is organized as follows:

- **Landing Page:** The landing page provides the user with options to navigate the web application and gives an overview of what to expect.

- **Weather Forecast:** Using the third-party weather api the weather forecast page allows users to search for their weather forecast and view future forecasts.

- **Contact Me:** The contact-me page allows users to fill in a form and submit it. The information from that form will be stored using an external form.
